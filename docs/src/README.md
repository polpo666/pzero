## Introduction

**pzero** is a framework developed based on the [go-zero framework](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero) and [go-zero/goctl tools](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tree/master/tools/goctl). It enables one-click initialization of api/gateway/rpc projects.

Based on describable files (**api/proto/sql**), it automatically generates **server-side and client-side** framework code. Combined with built-in pzero-skills, it empowers AI to generate business logic code that follows best practices, reducing development cognitive load and freeing your hands!

Key features include:

* Supports flexible control of pzero configurations through combinations of **configuration files/command-line parameters/environment variables**, with minimal commands to generate code, AI-friendly
* Supports generating code based on **git-changed files** or specific descriptor files, or ignoring specific descriptor files, improving code generation efficiency for large projects
* Built-in common development templates with enhanced template features, supports **custom templates** to build proprietary enterprise code templates, significantly reducing development costs
* Supports **plugin architecture**, where functional modules can be dynamically loaded as independent plugins, supporting plugin creation, compilation, and uninstallation, perfectly adapted for team collaboration and module decoupling

## Design Philosophy

* **Developer Experience**: Provides a simple, easy-to-use, one-stop production-ready solution that enhances the development experience
* **Template-Driven**: All code generation is based on template rendering, with default generation following best practices, and supports custom template content
* **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Does not modify go-zero and go-zero/goctl, maintains ecosystem compatibility while addressing existing pain points and extending new features
* **Team Development**: Through module **layering** and **plugin** design, it's friendly to team development
* **Interface Design**: Does not depend on specific databases/cache/config centers and other infrastructure, allowing free choice based on actual needs
